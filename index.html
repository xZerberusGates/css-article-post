					Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design
					and development! In this exercise, we'll play around with some of the
					common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice
					blog post-like web page.

				Headlines, like this one,class="uppercase-text are great ways to quickly
				capture the reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other
				important information in a web page. You can use
				<span class="red-text">text-transform: uppercase;</span>
				to make a whole body of text uppercase using CSS if you really need to
				grab attention!
			</p>
			<p class="first-two-para">
				Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which
				you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other components
				of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
				headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is
				intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty
				inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more
				difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At
				large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings, serif fonts are
				considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where
				serif characters start and where they end.
			</p>
			<p class="first-two-para">
				But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page?
				Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make
				quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so
				it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.

					"This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it
					some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience
					Design, where we take special care to implement our web page in a way
					that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers.
					Differentiating our different typography components visually makes
					information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."
