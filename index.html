					Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design

					common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice

				Headlines, like this one,class="uppercase-text are great ways to quickly
				capture the reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other
				important information in a web page. You can use
				<span class="red-text">text-transform: uppercase;</span>
				to make a whole body of text uppercase using CSS if you really need to
				grab attention!
			</p>
			<p class="first-two-para">
				Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which
				you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other components
				of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
				headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is
				intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty
				inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more
				difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At
				large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings, serif fonts are
				considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where
				serif characters start and where they end.
			</p>
			<p class="first-two-para">
				But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page?
				Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make
				quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so
				it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.

					Differentiating our different typography components visually makes

				<h4>And just like that, we've got a new section of content</h4>
				<p>
					It is separated by a hr element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider) and
					a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun? Notice as well that
					when we entered in the H3 content, it was all lowercase, but now it's
					in a nice Title Case, where the first letter of each word is
					capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using text-transform: capitalize;
					we can implement title cased content.

				<h4>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h4>
				<h5>px (pixels)</h5>
				<p>
					Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default
					the browser sets the root font size to 16px, but you can change the
					font size in the body element or any other HTML element by setting
					font-size to any number of px.
				</p>
				<h5>em</h5>
				<p>
					em units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the
					body element is 16px, and a nested div element's font size is set to
					1.5em, the browser will multiply 16px x 1.5, resulting in 24px font in
					the div.
				</p>
				<h5>rem (root em)</h5>
				<p>
					Root em units are similar to em, but they are relative to the root
					font size instead of the parent element of whatever is being styled.
					For example, if the root font size (the font size of the body element)
					is set to 16px, and we have a p element nested many layers down with a
					font-size set to 2rem, that paragraph will have 32px font. If the body
					font size ever changes, this paragraph will also change accordingly.
				</p>
				<h4>Which one do I use?</h4>
				<p>
					Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using em or rem over
					px, since they make responsive typography that scales up and down
					across different device widths much easier. Using px for your font
					sizes is not as dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries
					to update all the various element font sizes in pixels at different
					screen widths is not the most scalable approach to typography.
				</p>

				<p>
					Between em and rem, rem has a nice advantage of all elements being
					relative to one single root font value, where nested elements with
					parent/child font size dependencies can still be hard to manage with
					em units. When writing responsive styles, rem allows you to simply
					update the root font size at different screen sizes and all elements
					using rem units will adjust themselves accordingly creating a super
					easy-to-manage typography size system.
				</p>

				<p>
					In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but
					it's always important to understand the drawbacks of writing styles
					that may not be responsive or dynamic.
